# TempConverter

Index1.html - A temp converter example using oninput and onchange events that
calculate on every change in the textbox.
Also using type="number" on the input prevents textbox from
accepting any other value than number

Index2.html - This example use a button and onclick event of button
to calculate results.
We removed the oninput and onchange event handlers. 
Results gets calculated when button is clicked.

Index3.html - In this example we remove the attribute 'type' from input element
Any character will can used in the textbox.
But we add a calculation during the convert function in javascript
to check in the input value is a number.
If not, we show an error in the html
